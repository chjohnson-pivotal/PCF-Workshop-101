## Initial Steps
=== Proxy Setup

If your environment requires a proxy to access resources on the internet, you need to set a couple of envrionment variables in a terminal (Mac) or commmannd prompt (Windows)

For a Mac use these commands:
```
export HTTP_PROXY=<your http proxy>
export HTTPS_PROXY=<your https proxy>
```

For Windows use these commands:
```
set HTTP_PROXY=<your http proxy>
set HTTPS_PROXY=<your https proxy>
```

Validate that you have the CF CLI installed by running the following command:
```
$ cf
cf version 6.22.1+6b7af9c-2016-09-24, Cloud Foundry command line tool
Usage: cf [global options] command [arguments...] [command options]

Before getting started:
  config    login,l      target,t
  help,h    logout,lo

Application lifecycle:
  apps,a        logs      set-env,se
  push,p        ssh       create-app-manifest
  start,st      app
  stop,sp       env,e
  restart,rs    scale
  restage,rg    events

Services integration:
  marketplace,m        create-user-provided-service,cups
  services,s           update-user-provided-service,uups
  create-service,cs    create-service-key,csk
  update-service       delete-service-key,dsk
  delete-service,ds    service-keys,sk
  service              service-key
  bind-service,bs      bind-route-service,brs
  unbind-service,us    unbind-route-service,urs

Route and domain management:
  routes,r        delete-route    create-domain
  domains         map-route
  create-route    unmap-route

Space management:
  spaces         create-space    set-space-role
  space-users    delete-space    unset-space-role

Org management:
  orgs,o       set-org-role
  org-users    unset-org-role

CLI plugin management:
  plugins           add-plugin-repo      repo-plugins
  install-plugin    list-plugin-repos

Commands offered by installed plugins:
  zero-downtime-push    export-gemfire     show-wan-config-url
  disable-diego         gemfire            live-stats
  enable-diego          restart-gemfire
  has-diego-enabled     show-gfsh

Global options:
  --help, -h                         Show help
  -v                                 Print API request diagnostics to stdout

'cf help -a' lists all commands with short descriptions. See 'cf help <command>' to read about a specific command.

```

If you do not see the output from the CF CLI similar to what is shown above, set the CF_HOME environment variable to a writeable folder that already exists on your computer

For a Mac use the following command:
```
$ mkdir /pcf
$ export CF_HOME=/pcf
```

For Windows use the following command:
```
> md /pcf
> set CF_HOME=/pcf
```

And rerun the cf command to verify that it is working correctly.
