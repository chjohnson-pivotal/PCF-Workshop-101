# Deploying the Applications

In this exercise, we will be deploying all the applications in the project to the cloud.

### Perform the Gradle build

. Change to the cf-spring-trader directory.

Mac/Linux
```
$ cd cf-spring-trader
```

Windows
```
> cd cf-spring-trader
```

. Kick off the Gradle build

Mac/Linux
```
$ ./gradlew clean assemble
```

Windows
```
> gradlew.bat clean assemble
```
  
### Push the applications to CloudFoundry using the manifest-all.yml file

. Edit the manifest-all.yml to change the `name` field to something unique for each of the applications. Otherwise you will get an error if someone else deploys an app that uses the same hostname. (i.e. quotes-> quotes-initials, accounts -> accounts-initials, portfolio -> portfolio-initials, webtrader -> webtrader-initials). You do *not* need unique names for the services.

. cf push -f manifest-all.yml
